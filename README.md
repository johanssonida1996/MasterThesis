## 📜 Description


My degree project that I worked on at the end before I graduated. A professional website built in MVC, HTML, CSS and some JavaScript. Worked mostly with frontend and the application is also responsive and adapted for different platforms.

The application is a website built for job seekers and companies to easily find each other. Login options for different roles and you get access to different types of options depending on what you are logged in as.



## 🔜 Future iterations

My plan is to update this continously, add more functionality and hopfully one day publish this application.
